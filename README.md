# The Magic Formula
### A value investing strategy created by Joel Greenblatt (Managing Principal and Co-Chief Investment Officer of Gotham Asset Management).

This program is a slightly modified version of his strategy that outputs 35 stocks based off rankings in return on capital and earnings yield. 

## How does it work?

Every company listed on the NASDAQ and NYSE is filtered through the program in Step 1, leaving only companies with a market capitalization between $200M and $200B. 

Then in Step 2, this filtered list is ranked based off of earnings yield and return on capital. The two rankings are added together to create a combined ranking.

The output is the 35 stocks with the lowest combined ranking.
